                    <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">ESG Risk Ratings help investors assess the degree
                        to which a company’s enterprise
                        business value is at risk driven by environmental, social and governance issues. The rating
                        employs a two-dimensional framework that combines an assessment of a company’s exposure to
                        industry-specific material ESG issues with an assessment of how well the company is managing
                        those issues. The final ESG Risk Rating scores are a measure of unmanaged risk on an absolute
                        scale of 0-100, with a lower score signaling better risk management.</p>

                    <p>The story of ESG investing began in January 2004 when former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
                        wrote to over 50 CEOs of major financial institutions, inviting them to participate in a joint
                        initiative under the auspices of the UN Global Compact and with the support of the International
                        Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Swiss Government. .</p>

                            href="https://www.unpri.org/">2006</a></h2>
                    <p>A year later this initiative produced a report entitled “Who Cares Wins,” with Ivo Knoepfel as
                        the author. The report made the case that embedding environmental, social and governance factors
                        in capital markets makes good business sense and leads to more sustainable markets and better
                        outcomes for societies. At the same time United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative
                        (UNEP FI) produced the so-called “Freshfield Report”
                        which showed that ESG issues are relevant for financial valuation. These two reports formed the
                        backbone for the launch of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) at the New York Stock
                        Exchange in 2006 and the launch of the Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative (SSEI) the
                        following year.</p>

                    <p>Institutional investors were initially reluctant to embrace the concept, arguing that their
                        fiduciary duty was limited to the maximization of shareholder values irrespective of
                        environmental or social impacts, or broader governance issues such as corruption. Incredibly,
                        such arguments are still being made. But as evidence has grown that ESG issues have financial
                        implications, the tide has shifted. In many important markets, including the U.S. and the EU,
                        ESG integration is increasingly seen as part of fiduciary duty.
                        <br> Another major barrier has been a lack of data and the necessary tools to get a handle on
                        the fragmented and incomplete information available. However, corporate disclosure on ESG issues
                        has steadily improved. More recently, the International
                        Integrated Reporting Initiative (IIRC) and the US-based Sustainability Accounting Standard Board
                        (SASB) have helped to advance industry sector-specific reporting and its relevance for
                        investors. Overall, the market for ESG information is maturing and quality, while still
                        imperfect, is getting better all the time. And new technology based on machine learning and big
                        data can already unlock valuable insights and offer easy ways to apply ESG data in addition to
                        conventional financial information.</p>

                    <p>The steady growth of ESG investing was greatly accelerated around 2013 and 2014 when the first
                        studies were published showing that good corporate sustainability performance is associated with
                        good financial results. Work by academics such as George Serafeim, Bob Eccles and Ioannis
                        Ioannou shows the importance of ESG information for assessing corporate risks, strategies and
                        operational performance.</p>

                    <p>Cynics may argue that responsible investing is just a fad. But a closer look at the forces that
                        have driven the movement over the past 15 years suggests otherwise. Firstly, technology and the
                        rise of transparency are here to stay. Gathering and processing data will become ever easier and
                        cheaper. Smart algorithms will increasingly allow for better interpretation of non-traditional
                        financial information which seems to be doubling in volume every couple of years. Secondly,
                        environmental changes, in particular climate change, will with scientific certainty put a
                        growing premium on good stewardship and low carbon practices as natural assets will appreciate
                        in value over time. And thirdly, people everywhere are increasingly empowered by technology. ESG
                        investing allows them to express their own values and to ensure that their savings and
                        investments reflect their preferences, without compromising on returns.<p></p>

                        Today, ESG scores are increasingly reported on major sites and financial tools including: Yahoo
                        Finance, Bloomberg Terminal, Morningstar, MSCI, Fidelity, Forbes Money, Kipliger, and more.
                        Almost every top 10 business school has already incorporated it into their cirriculums, and the
                        worlds top investment CEOs no longer see it as a fad either.

                        <p></p>Harvard's Business Review "interviewed 70 senior executives
                        at 43 global institutional investing firms, including the world’s three biggest asset managers
                        (BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street) and giant asset owners such as the California Public
                        Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), the California State Teachers’ Retirement System
                        (CalSTRS), and the government pension funds of Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. We know of no
                        other research effort that involved so many senior leaders at so many of the largest investment
                        firms. We found that ESG was almost universally top of mind for these executives.

                        <p></p>
                        Of course, investors have been voicing concerns about sustainability for several decades. But
                        not until recently have they translated their words into action. Most of the investment leaders
                        in our study described meaningful steps their firms are taking to integrate sustainability
                        issues into their investing criteria. It was clear to us that corporate leaders will soon be
                        held accountable by shareholders for ESG performance—if they aren’t already."</p>
